# Monty Hall

The game consists of the following: Monty Hall, the presenter, presents three or more doors to competitors. Behind one of them is a prize, and behind the others there was nothing.

- In the 1st stage, the competitor chooses one of the doors (which is not yet open);
- In the 2nd stage, Monty opens one of the other doors that the competitor did not choose, revealing that the prize is not found on that door and revealing the empty door;
- In the 3rd stage Monty asks the competitor if he wants to decide to stay with the door he chose at the beginning of the game or if he wants to change to the other door that is still closed and then open it. Now, with two or more doors to choose from — as one of them was already seen, in the 2nd stage, which did not have the prize — and knowing that the prize is behind one of the others, the competitor has to make the decision.

What is the most logical strategy? Stick with the initially chosen port or change ports? Which of the closed doors is the competitor more likely to win with? Why?
